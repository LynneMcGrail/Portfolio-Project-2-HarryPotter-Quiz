### Final Design 
![Final project image home page]()

### Initial Requirements
#### The main features that I wanted to include are:
* Interactive quiz elements to enhance user experience.
* A progress bar so that the user can see how far through the quiz they are, and how many questions are left.
* A score keeper for amount of correct answers.
* Colour indicators that let the user know if the answer they selected is correct (green) or incorrect (red), the quiz will also highlight the correct answer in green, should the user guess the incorrect answer (highlighted in red) throughout the gameplay. 
* To use a colour scheme which signifies colours that users would associate with Harry Potter, I have used scarlett and gold throughout as they are the Gryffindor colours, and this is the house Harry is in.
* To create an easy to navigate quiz with buttons so that the user can navigate home, to play the game, save their score at the end and visit the highscores page. The user can also navigate back to the home page at any point during the quiz should they not wish to finish the game.
* For the quiz to look fun and interactive through colours, images and icons which are symbolic of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Note the broomstick and castle Font Awesome icons used within the quiz. The background audio is also the theme song for Harry Potter which aims to enhance the users experience and enjoyment.
* To include social network links in the footer to my professional portfolio, my Github and Linkedin accounts.
* To be fully responsive so the user can play across multiple platforms.

* The user must be able to give up on the quiz if they wish to, and return to the homepage.

## First Time Visitor Goals
