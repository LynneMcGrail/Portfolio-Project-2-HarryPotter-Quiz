# Harry Potter Quiz #

## Goals for this project 
This Harry Potter Quiz is an interactive online quiz designed for users who would like to test their knowledge of the Harry Potter universe, in a fun way and a means to calculate the final score and compare it on the leaderboard of highscores, a.k.a The Hogwarts House Cup. My target audience is Harry Potter fans and their friends and family. This covers a large part of the population. The target demographic is incredibly mixed, as Harry Potter is enjoyed by people of all ages and genders.

## Initial Requirements

The main features that I wanted to include are:

Interactive quiz elements.
A score counter for correct answers.
A progress bar so that the user can see how far through the quiz they are.
Choose your house, and the questions correlate to which house is chosen.
Audio that can be toggled on and off, which changes depending on which page you're on.
A timer that ends the quiz if the time runs out.


* The Features I wanted the project to have are:
    * Interactive quiz elements.
    * A score counter for correct answers.
    * For the quiz to highlight the correct answer in green, should the user guess the incorrect answer (highlighted in red) throughout the gameplay. 
    * To use a colour scheme which signifies colours fans would associate with Harry Potter, I have used scarlett and gold throughout as they are the Gryffindor colours, and the house Harry is in.
    * To have an easy to navigate "Nav Bar".
    * Look fun and interactive through colours, images and icons which are symbolic of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Note the broomstick and castle used within the quiz.
    * To include social network links in the footer to my professional portfolio, my Github and Linkedin accounts.
