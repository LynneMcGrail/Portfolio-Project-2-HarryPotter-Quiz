### Final Design 
![Final project image home page]()

### Initial Requirements
#### The main features that I wanted to include are:
* Interactive quiz elements to enhance user experience.
* A progress bar so that the user can see how far through the quiz they are, and how many questions are left.
* A score keeper for amount of correct answers.
* Colour indicators that let the user know if the answer they selected is correct (green) or incorrect (red), the quiz will also highlight the correct answer in green, should the user guess the incorrect answer (highlighted in red) throughout the gameplay. 
* To use a colour scheme which signifies colours that users would associate with Harry Potter, I have used scarlett and gold throughout as they are the Gryffindor colours, and this is the house Harry is in.
* To create an easy to navigate quiz with buttons so that the user can navigate home, to play the game, save their score at the end and visit the highscores page. The user can also navigate back to the home page at any point during the quiz should they not wish to finish the game.
* For the quiz to look fun and interactive through colours, images and icons which are symbolic of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Note the broomstick and castle Font Awesome icons used within the quiz. The background audio is also the theme song for Harry Potter which aims to enhance the users experience and enjoyment.
* To include social network links in the footer to my professional portfolio, my Github and Linkedin accounts.
* To be fully responsive so the user can play across multiple platforms.

# User Experience (UX)
## Site Goals
* The provide an interactive experience that is easily accessible in terms of navigation and to manouver throughout the site.
* The quiz end score needs to be personalised to each user.
* It needs to be easy to see thier progress and how many questions there are.
* To display how many correct points the user has achieved throughout the quiz at all times.
* It needs to be instantly engaging to enourage the user to play the game.
* Questions to be randomised and drawn from a bank of available questions.
* The user must be able to give up on the quiz if they wish to, and return to the homepage.

## First Time Visitor Goals
* I want it to be easy for the user to start game play.
* I want the user to be able to easily navigate throughout the site.
* I want the user to be able to visit the leaderboard and review their highscores.

## Returning & Frequent Visitor Goals

## Design Wireframes

## Site Structure
The Harry Potter quiz consists of multiple screens as the user interacts with and navigates through the quiz. The Home screen offers two navigation paths, one to enter the quiz, and another to see the highscores. Each screen has identifiable controls on them; the home page allows the user to initiate game play, also the sound icon enables the user to toggle the sound on or off. When the user progresses to play the quiz, they will find a home button to escape at any point, the progress bar will appear in gameplay to track questions answered out of total in quiz e.g. 1 of 10, and a score keeper which tallies the user's score as they progress through the quiz. Upon finishing the quiz the user is immediately taken to the results screen that gives the option to input their username and save their highscore, which will then show them the "House Cup" page. From the results screen they can also navigate back to the home page, or play the game again instantly.

## Design Choices
### Colour Scheme 
The final color scheme chosen was a rich dark red (scarlet) colour, and a gold colour. This colour scheme directly links back with the theme of the project: Harry Potter. These colours are often associated with Harry Potter, the main character, because of his association with the Gryffindor house, who's colours are red / scarlet and gold. The other colours used tie in with the theme of the project, which you can see the Hogwart's castle is captured at night, therefore the other colours used compliment the appearance and user experience. I used Coolors as my color palette generator to see them compliment each other side by side.

### Typography
The fonts chosen were Pathway Gothic and set to cursive for the main text, Sans-serif is the fallback font. I used Google Fonts to import into my css styling.

I chose this font as it ties nicely with the theme of the project. There is quite a historic vintage feel to the font, and with the right styling I think it fits in with the Harry Potter theme and also works well alongside the Harry Potter logo in my project.
