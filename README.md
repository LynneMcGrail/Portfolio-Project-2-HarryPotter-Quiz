# Harry Potter Quiz
## Purpose
A Quiz is an intellectual game where the user's knowledge is tested in both a challenging and entertaining way, with feedback on each answer (correct or incorrect) and joining the leaderboard on completion.

### Final Design 
![Final project image home page]()

### Initial Requirements
#### The main features that I wanted to include are:
* Interactive quiz elements to enhance user experience.
* A progress bar so that the user can see how far through the quiz they are.
* A score counter for correct answers.
* For the quiz to highlight the correct answer in green, should the user guess the incorrect answer (highlighted in red) throughout the gameplay. 
* To use a colour scheme which signifies colours fans would associate with Harry Potter, I have used scarlett and gold throughout as they are the Gryffindor colours, and the house Harry is in.
* To have an easy to navigate "Nav Bar".
* Look fun and interactive through colours, images and icons which are symbolic of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Note the broomstick and castle used within the quiz.
* To include social network links in the footer to my professional portfolio, my Github and Linkedin accounts.

# User Experience (UX)
## User Stories
### Client Goals
* The quiz needs to be easily accessible to navigate and manouver throughout the site.
* The quiz end score needs to be personalised to each user.
* It needs to be easy to see how many questions there are.
* It needs to be displayed how many correct points the user has achieved throughout the quiz.
* It needs to be instantly engaging to enourage the user to play the game.
* Questions will be randomised and drawn from a bank of available questions.
* The user must be able to give up on the quiz if they wish to, and return to the homepage.

#### First Time Visitor Goals
* I want it to be easy to understand how to start playing.
* I want it to be able to easily navigate throughout the site.
* I want the user to be able to visit the leaderboard at any point.

#### Returning & Frequent Visitor Goals
* I want to have different questions by randomising the question generator, in order to increase replayability and enhance user experience.
