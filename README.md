## Initial Idea Concept
My initial idea for the project was to create an informative and welcoming website about the activity of hiking in Ireland. My target audience is anyone who is interested in the activity itself or seeking to benefit their health and well-being, whilst meeting new people and establishing social connections.
This site can be any age group, any gender and any experience level. The site is safe for all age ranges from children to adults who want to learn about hiking in Ireland. I chose to make the site bright to display the information clearly and so people could navigate it easily.

* The Features I wanted the project to have are:
    * To make the site easy to read.
    * To have a light colour scheme (white background, dark text colour and complimenting bright colours throughout to represent nature which also tie in with the colours in the hero image).
    * To have an easy to navigate "Nav Bar".
    * Look fun and inviting with images, and to be educational on the health benefits associated with hiking.
    * To feature a map embedded to highlight where the Hiking Club's locality is based.
    * To be easy to make contact with the club through social media or the contact form on the site.
