### Final Design 
![Final project image home page]()

### Initial Requirements
#### The main features that I wanted to include are:
* Interactive quiz elements to enhance user experience.
* A progress bar so that the user can see how far through the quiz they are, and how many questions are left.
* A score keeper for amount of correct answers.
* Colour indicators that let the user know if the answer they selected is correct (green) or incorrect (red), the quiz will also highlight the correct answer in green, should the user guess the incorrect answer (highlighted in red) throughout the gameplay. 
* To use a colour scheme which signifies colours that users would associate with Harry Potter, I have used scarlett and gold throughout as they are the Gryffindor colours, and this is the house Harry is in.
* To create an easy to navigate quiz with buttons so that the user can navigate home, to play the game, save their score at the end and visit the highscores page. The user can also navigate back to the home page at any point during the quiz should they not wish to finish the game.
* For the quiz to look fun and interactive through colours, images and icons which are symbolic of The Wizarding World of Harry Potter. Note the broomstick and castle Font Awesome icons used within the quiz. The background audio is also the theme song for Harry Potter which aims to enhance the users experience and enjoyment.
* To include social network links in the footer to my professional portfolio, my Github and Linkedin accounts.
* To be fully responsive so the user can play across multiple platforms.

# User Experience (UX)
## Site Goals
* The provide an interactive experience that is easily accessible in terms of navigation and to manouver throughout the site.
* The quiz end score needs to be personalised to each user.
* It needs to be easy to see thier progress and how many questions there are.
* To display how many correct points the user has achieved throughout the quiz at all times.
* It needs to be instantly engaging to enourage the user to play the game.
* Questions to be randomised and drawn from a bank of available questions.
* The user must be able to give up on the quiz if they wish to, and return to the homepage.

## First Time Visitor Goals
* I want it to be easy for the user to start game play.
* I want the user to be able to easily navigate throughout the site.
* I want the user to be able to visit the leaderboard and review their highscores.

## Returning & Frequent Visitor Goals
* I want to have different questions by randomising the question generator, in order to increase replayability and enhance user experience.
* To be able to review their top high scores to beat them by replaying the quiz and building on their Harry Potter knowledge. 

## User Stories

## Design Wireframes

## Site Structure
The Harry Potter quiz consists of multiple screens as the user interacts with and navigates through the quiz. The Home screen offers two navigation paths, one to enter the quiz, and another to see the highscores. Each screen has identifiable controls on them; the home page allows the user to initiate game play, also the sound icon enables the user to toggle the sound on or off. When the user progresses to play the quiz, they will find a home button to escape at any point, the progress bar will appear in gameplay to track questions answered out of total in quiz e.g. 1 of 10, and a score keeper which tallies the user's score as they progress through the quiz. Upon finishing the quiz the user is immediately taken to the results screen that gives the option to input their username and save their highscore, which will then show them the "House Cup" page. From the results screen they can also navigate back to the home page, or play the game again instantly.

## Design Choices
### Colour Scheme 
The final color scheme chosen was a rich dark red (scarlet) colour, and a gold colour. This colour scheme directly links back with the theme of the project: Harry Potter. These colours are often associated with Harry Potter, the main character, because of his association with the Gryffindor house, who's colours are red / scarlet and gold. The other colours used tie in with the theme of the project, which you can see the Hogwart's castle is captured at night, therefore the other colours used compliment the appearance and user experience. I used Coolors as my color palette generator to see them compliment each other side by side.

### Typography
The fonts chosen were Pathway Gothic and set to cursive for the main text, Sans-serif is the fallback font. I used Google Fonts to import into my css styling.

I chose this font as it ties nicely with the theme of the project. There is quite a historic vintage feel to the font, and with the right styling I think it fits in with the Harry Potter theme and also works well alongside the Harry Potter logo in my project.

# Features
This Harry Potter Quiz was created to produce an immersive experience for the user through the use of both design and site structure. It moves away from the typical website structure with the menubar and is structured and designed more like a game.

It is intuitively designed so the user can easily navigate it, along with visible and recognisable Home and Sound button icons, and visual ques reflecting the topic.

## Navigation
* The site navigation is done through the clickable buttons which easily indicate how to navigate the game to the user. Throughout the site the user will find these buttons at hand to navigate away from their current stage at any point.
* The user can navigate to the home screen from wherever they are in the quiz through the home button. This has an icon of a castle, significant to the theme itself and easily recognised as a 'home' button feature. 
* The sound button is automatically muted on the website loading, but the sound can be activated or muted by the user, as they wish.
* Upon activation, the background music is the Harry Potter theme song, instantly recognised by Harry Potter fans and provides an immersive magical experience creating the atmosphere of the Harry Potter phenomenon.
* On the quiz starting the user will notice two informative icons are added to their gameplay experience: the game progress bar, and the user's score.
* On completion of the game the user will notice the ability to enter their username, save their score, visit the House Cup leaderboard, and be able to navigate to the home page or play the quiz again.

## Home Page
* The Home Page is the screen that's visible first when the user enters the site. It is designed to be immediately recognisable to the user and easily allow the user to immediately start playing the quiz.
* In the middle of the screen, the user will see the quiz main content centered, a familiar quote from the books and movies "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good" and this is lay over a very recognisable Harry Potter themed background, the Hogwart's Castle.
* The title and logo sit on top of the quiz content, again giving the user information as to what topic the quiz is about.
* The user is presented with two buttons; a play button, and a Highscores button and from here the user has all that is required to play the quiz.

## Bugs and errors
### Solved bugs and errors

# Testing
## Code Validation and Accessibility
### JSHint 
The Javascript files were validated through JSHint. Due to there being multiple Javascript files, validating each page threw up multiple warnings, many of which were undefined varibles. This was due to the variables and functions being defined or called on other pages. The missing semicolon warnings do not affect functionality of the code.

JSHint came up with no errors and multiple warnings which are explained below in [Unresolved Bugs](<#unresolved-bugs>).

## **Lighthouse**
The quiz was also put through Lighthouse testing via Chrome DevTools which tests the site under 4 different headings; Performance, Accessibility, Best Practices and SEO and it tests it under mobile and desktop criteria.
